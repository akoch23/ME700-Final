# Leaf Spring Simulation: Skills Demonstrated

This simulation of a stacked leaf spring using the finite element method in DOLFINx demonstrates a comprehensive set of computational mechanics and software development skills. The code showcases a strong understanding of matrix structural analysis and finite element techniques through its variational formulation for linear elasticity, use of quadrilateral meshing, and application of boundary and load conditions. From a software development perspective, it illustrates well-structured and documented Python programming, integration of external libraries (e.g., PyVista, HDF5), and thoughtful debugging strategies, such as runtime file inspection and validation outputs. Professionally, the implementation is clearly organized with instructional output and visualization support, facilitating technical communication. Furthermore, the project integrates mechanical theory with practical software engineering, resulting in a modular and extensible solution. This serves as a solid example of end-to-end application of computational mechanics in Python.
